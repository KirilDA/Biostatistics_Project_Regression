# Biostatistics_Project_Regression


Project overview: 

  Objective: Create the best equation for predicting the oxygen capacity of an individual based on several physiological
  measurements-RunTime, RunPulse, RestPulse, RunTime, MaxPulse. The experiment setup is straightforward — instead of using
  expensive medical equipment to determine lung capacity, we use easily measurable physical parameters collected from 
  participants in a fitness challenge.
  
  Methods: A Linear Regression model is applied to estimate oxygen capacity. The analysis includes verifying the main assumptions
  of linear regression to ensure the model’s validity and reliability.

  Important steps: 
    1) Examine the ditribution of all variables
    2) Analyze correlations between independent variables
    3) Build an initial regression model
    4) Refine the model by removing non-informative predictors
    5) Plot residuals and perform model diagnostics

  Additional information: A presentation with detailed results and visualizations is included in the project folder.
